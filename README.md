While learning Machine Learning on YouTube last week, I discovered that the platform doesn't display the total duration of a playlist. This makes it difficult to estimate the time commitment required. To address this, I developed a tool to calculate it, and this repository contains the resulting project.

# üé¨ YouTube Playlist Duration Calculator

> A beautiful desktop application built with Python and Tkinter that calculates the total duration of YouTube playlists with a modern, user-friendly interface.
